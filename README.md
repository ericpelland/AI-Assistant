The AI Browser Assistant is a Google Chrome browser extension that uses advanced AI technology from OpenAI to help users understand and interact with text on the web. With just a few clicks, users can:

- Translate selected text into a different language
- Summarize selected text to get the main points
- Complete selected text by suggesting the next word or phrase
- Respond to selected text with a relevant comment or answer
- Explain selected text by providing additional context and information
- Chat directly with the AI model using the built-in chat feature

## Customizing the AI Model and Settings

In the Settings tab, you can customize the following options:

- **Model:** Select the AI model that you want to use for translations, summaries, completions, responses, and explanations.
- **Temperature:** Adjust the temperature of the AI model to control the creativity and randomness of its output.
- **Max Tokens:** Set the maximum number of tokens (words and punctuation) that the AI model should generate.
- **Top P:** Set the top P value to control the proportion of the mass of the distribution that the AI model should generate.
- **Frequency Penalty:** Adjust the frequency penalty to control the likelihood of the AI model generating frequent words and phrases.
- **Presence Penalty:** Adjust the presence penalty to control the likelihood of the AI model generating words and phrases that are not present in the input text.

## Notes
- Created in one sitting session utilizing chatGPT.  Believe it or not most of this project was AI generated including this entire readme (except this line).  I personally made some modifications here and there, and spent time doing a refactor at the end.
- Some features of the AI Browser Assistant may not be available for certain languages or models.
- The AI model is trained on a large dataset of text, and may generate responses that are inappropriate or offensive. Use at your own risk.
